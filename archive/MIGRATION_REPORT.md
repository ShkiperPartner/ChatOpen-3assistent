## 📝 Migration Notes

**What was migrated:**
- Project overview and elevator pitch
- Technology stack (React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase)
- Current implementation status (v1.4 with MaaS microservice)
- Security rules (API key management, RLS policies, OpenAI integration)
- Completed features list

**What was NOT migrated (kept as templates):**
- User Personas (not defined in legacy docs)
- User Flows (not defined in legacy docs)
- Detailed data structure (need manual filling)

**Reason:** Legacy docs focused on architecture and implementation, not on product planning/UX. These sections should be filled based on actual product requirements.
